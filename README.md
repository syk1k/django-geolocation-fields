    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        #...
        'geolocation_fields',
    ]
    ```

2. Add a PointField to a model:
    ```python
    from geolocation_fields.models import fields
    field_name = fields.PointField(verbose_name='field_name')
    ```

3. Configurations 
    To have more control over the package, you can canfigure it yourself

    By default the PointField's widget only display the map, 
    you can also chose to display the editable input field in the settings
    ```python
    GEOLOCATION_FIELD = {
        'display_input': True, # Display the input field. False to remove
    }
    ```

    Here is the default configuration for the fields (PointField for the moment).
    The configurations uses leaflet Map options. Check the leafletJS
